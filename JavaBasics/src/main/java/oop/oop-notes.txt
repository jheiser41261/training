Java is an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Language
- OOP is a system of referencing "objects" to refer to real-world objects

OOP has four core pillars:
- Inheritance
    - Passing state/behavior from a parent class to a child class
        - Ex: Your parents pass DNA onto you
    - In Java:
        - Use the keyword "extends" on a class
            - Each child class can only have one parent
            - Each class can be extended by multiple children
- Abstraction
    - Hiding how something is done
        - Ex: A car; we don't need to understand how it works, just that it does
    - In Java:
        - Abstract classes
        - Interfaces
- Encapsulation
    - The restriction of direct access
        - Ex: A vending machine; we don't get the product ourselves, the machine gets it for us
    - In Java:
        - Access modifiers (public, private, default, protected)
            - Generally, the variables in classes should be private
- Polymorphism
    - The idea of taking on many forms
        - Ex: Water; water will take the form of whatever vessel it is put in
    - In Java:
        - Overriding
            - Having a method in a child class with the same signature as a method in its parent class
        - Overloading
            - Having a method in the same class with the same name, but with different parameters
                - Constructors are a perfect example of this
